## Minesweeper version: Go

Welcome to my refactor of my original Java minesweeper project as Go/Golang!

### Overview

This is a refactor of the procedural version of my Java minesweeper clone. This project was made as a final "basic project" after learning the basics of Go.

#### Design

I have made the code much cleaner in this project as this time I knew exactly I wanted in terms of game functionality (with my original Java project I added additional features after the MVP was met leading to more "messy" code). Additionally, I added comments to further solidify my learning/understanding of Golang syntax whilst also improving readibility (to a standard I consider as "good code"). I also added comments and commented out code for the purposes of manual testing during development so that other devs can manually test it without having to write their own code.

I aimed to reduce repeated code into functions and have functions "do one thing only" (pure functions) where possible. I also tried to use as many of Go's features as I could ("sweetners", various Go packages) and I also made sure that I had appropriate testing.
